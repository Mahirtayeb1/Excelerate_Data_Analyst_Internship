ðŸ“Œ Week 1 â€“ Task Breakdown
1. Dataset Understanding

Review the three provided datasets:


Applicant Data


Outreach Data


Campaign Data



Study their schema, field names, data types, and relationships.


Example:


Applicant ID links with Outreach Data.


Campaign ID links with Campaign Data.




2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Perform an initial analysis of the datasets to identify:


Trends & Patterns â†’ seasonal changes, spikes, correlations.


Anomalies â†’ outliers, incorrect values.


Missing Values â†’ missing dates, IDs, statuses.


Categorical Issues â†’ spelling mistakes, inconsistent categories.


ðŸ‘‰ Create visualizations (histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, heatmaps) and include screenshots in the report.


3. Data Cleaning

Handle missing values (impute, remove, or flag).


Remove duplicates (e.g., same Applicant ID appearing multiple times).


Correct inaccuracies (typos, invalid phone numbers, wrong date ranges).


Apply standardization (date formats, text casing, numeric precision).


Perform validation checks to ensure data is consistent after cleaning.



4. PostgreSQL Setup

Install and configure PostgreSQL.


Create a new database.


Import cleaned datasets into PostgreSQL.


Run basic SQL queries (e.g., SELECT, COUNT) and capture proof (screenshots/output).



5. Master Table Creation

Integrate Applicant Data, Outreach Data, and Campaign Data using defined relationships.


Build a Master Table as the single source of truth for future visualizations.


Validate relationships (Primary Key, Foreign Key constraints).
